Online Shoppers Intention dataset (provided at UCI Machine Learning Repository) is used
to cluster the data to provide helpful insights. Explored two different clustering techniques and compared their performances with two evaluation metrics.

The clustering techniques performed are:
- K-means
- Complete-Linkage Agglomerative nesting

The metrics used for comparison are:
- Rand Index
- Davies-Bouldin Index

# Pre-requisites::
	1) Below packages are required for the program to run without issues:
		- pandas
		- numpy
	2) Python 3.7 should be installed on the system on which the application will be used
